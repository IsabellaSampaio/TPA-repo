# Advanced Programming Techniques repository

### In this repostory I'll be uploading content during the Information Systems (IS) course "Advanced Programming Techniques" to help me organize my studies and also, help students that want more knowledge in data structures and algorithms, object oriented programming and techiniques to better implement their coding solutions. 

### The course's main objective is to help students plan, analyze and implement their coding solutions in a better and more "real world" way. 
### In this course we'll be studying topics such as:
- Big O notation
- Sorting Algorithms 
- Trees and Binary Trees 
- Sequential Search and Binary Search
